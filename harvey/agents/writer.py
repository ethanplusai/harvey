"""Writer — crafts personalized email sequences.

With a native mail provider (Gmail/SMTP), email 1 is written PER PROSPECT
from grounded facts — the company's own description, detected tech stack,
and buying signals — instead of one merge-tag template shared by a whole
batch. Mass-templated "token-swap" mail is exactly what inbox filters now
cluster and junk; a specific, verifiable first line is what earns replies.
Steps 2-3 stay campaign-level (proof point + breakup are less personal by
design). Every draft still passes the deterministic pre-send gate.
